# outbreak-simulator
Simulation of disease outbreaks, such as COVID.

Used pygame.

Red --> Infected <br>
Blue --> Dead<br>
Green --> Immune<br>
Grey --> Susceptible<br>
Pink --> Connection Lines

I recently added graphing, so once nobody is infected the program stops running and a graph with data pops up. If you would like to download the data, you can save the image in the graph viewer, and there is also a csv file containing data of the most recent run stored in the root of the directory.
